\begin{cvletter}

I am writing to express my interest as a software developer internship at \position. I am an experienced software developer with experience working with many types of applications. I also take initiative and I believe that I readily meet all the qualifications of the position. 

I am a third year Computer Science Specialist at the University of Toronto, St. George campus. I have a wide range of experience, from creating mobile apps, video games, website front-end, and REST servers. I am comfortable with a variety of languages, from C++ to Java, from Javascript to Python. I am also familiar with both SQL and noSQL databases, having taken a course in SQL as well as doing several projects using noSQL frameworks.

I am a strong team player who would be an asset to any development team. Having worked on many software projects, I believe that having a process is key to success. This is especially evident during my time at Zhi Yin. Our task was to create a social media platform centered around music. We were given a strict timeline of one month to complete this project, and we only completed it due to strict adherence to an agile framework.

I am confident that as a hard worker that I would exceed your expectations. Thank you for taking the time to read my application, and I look forward to hearing back from you.
